#Game of PIG
#Multiplayer Game
#Each turn the player rolls a die
#Die can be rolled as many times as the player wants
#If during their rolls the player rolls anything other than 1, that number is to be #added to their score once they end their turn
#If the player rolls a 1, the player's score to be added is 0 for that turn
#Player wins when they reach 50 points!
